Scope statement



Justification

Context of the Project
The project aims to detect and report any suspicious or abnormal human behavior in a given area, with the goal of preventing theft.

Problematic
Due to the inability to monitor certain areas 24/7, there is an increased risk of theft and unauthorized access to the area.

Ambitions
Our goal is to develop a surveillance system that sends alerts to the three nearest responsible parties when abnormal behavior is detected, enabling them to take appropriate action.

Scope Description

- Areas in need of 24/24 surveillance systems
- Immediate detection of theft attempts
- Our solution will be utilized by individuals or organizations seeking to enhance security and control access to specific areas, such as banks, schools, hospitals, and various types of building

- Our solution is designed to guarantee round-the-clock security and rapid responsiveness by notifying the nearest individuals when any suspicious behavior is detected at a specific location.
