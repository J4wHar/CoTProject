# Human Abnormal Behavior Detection Project ðŸš€

## Overview

This academic project, conducted within the Cloud of Things module at SUPCOM, focuses on addressing security concerns in sensitive areas such as banks, schools, and hospitals. The primary objective is to develop a system capable of detecting abnormal human behavior, such as stealing or fighting, utilizing a computer vision model.

## Context

In response to the growing need for heightened security, this project employs computer vision technology to detect and monitor abnormal human behavior. The system operates around the clock, ensuring constant surveillance of designated areas. In the event of detecting any suspicious activity, the system promptly alerts the three nearest application users to the incident location. This approach not only enhances security measures but also facilitates swift response actions, thereby safeguarding crucial environments like banks, schools, and hospitals.
